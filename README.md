# Helios - Lightweight PHP Framework

Helios is a lightweight, flexible PHP framework tailored for building modern web applications. Designed with simplicity and scalability in mind, Helios integrates seamlessly with **htmx** to deliver dynamic, interactive user interfaces. Whether you're exploring new development approaches or working on a personal project, Helios provides the tools to make web development more intuitive and efficient.

## Features

- **Lightweight**: Minimal overhead, focusing on performance and simplicity.
- **htmx Integration**: Built-in support for htmx, allowing you to create reactive and interactive front-ends without JavaScript.
- **Flexible**: Customizable and extensible to suit your specific project needs.
- **Learning-Oriented**: Ideal for developers looking to experiment with PHP and modern web development techniques.

## Project Status

Helios is a **hobby project** developed for learning and experimentation purposes. While it provides a robust foundation for web application development, it is not designed or tested for **production environments** or **mission-critical** use cases. For production-grade applications, consider using established frameworks with proven security and performance track records.
